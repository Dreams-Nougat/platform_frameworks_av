does sample samples_per_channel_ mean the same thing as _payloadDataLengthInSamples?
The name seems to indicate differently.
It seems to be the number of multi channel samples that is 
session->apmFrameCount should not be multiplied by session->inChannelCount

I have not looked into details of this PreProcessing.cpp file,
but the comment for class AudioFrame in
webrtc/src/modules/interface/module_common_types.h
looks like so.

The older version says:

 * - _payloadDataLengthInSamples is the number of
 *   samples per channel. Therefore, the total
 *   number of samples in _payloadData is
 *   (_payloadDataLengthInSamples * _audioChannel).

and the newer version says:

 * - The total number of samples in |data_| is
 *   samples_per_channel_ * num_channels_

The other code in module_common_types.h also look like
a simple rename of data members in the AudioFrame class.
