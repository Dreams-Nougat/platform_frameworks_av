866->869 should be retained even with brillo, since otherwise the reporting of client UID/PID in the camera service will be incorrect (in dumpsys, etc).  (just set clientUid = getCallingUid(), clientPid = getCallingPid() )

Also, how do you expect service arbitration to work (or are you leaving that for a future problem?)

I'd also be happier with this if we factored out the body within the #if into a separate method (maybe validateClientPermissionsLocked?) so that the #ifdef is harder to mess up.
