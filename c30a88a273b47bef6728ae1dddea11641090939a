according to the spec that I have, this frame count must be 1, on page 28 in section 8.16.1; and then in section 8.16.3, "frame_count indicates how many frames of compressed video are stored in each sample. The default is 
1, for one frame per sample; it may be more than 1 for multiple frames per sample".

0 does not make sense.

Note, I'm not touching the frame count field, that is still 1. I'm changing the compressor string.
