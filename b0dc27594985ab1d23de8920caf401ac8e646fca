we should wait with a timeout here (1- 3 seconds) s that we are not stuck if the requesting thread is stuck because ::Exit() only signals mWaitWorkCV.
I realize there is also a problem in ::exit() because we do not signal all pending commands when exiting.

Would you like the change to exit to signal the pending commands done in same commit or a different one?
