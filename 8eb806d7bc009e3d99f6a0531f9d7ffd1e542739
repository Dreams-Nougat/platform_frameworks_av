1. Why pick highest segment start time instead of the lowest, as the original logic in the code?

2. Could you please elaborate more on your comments? A simple example would help. Do you mean audio/video TO audio only? When switching FROM audio only we wouldn't have multiple (segment) start times to compare each other against, no?
