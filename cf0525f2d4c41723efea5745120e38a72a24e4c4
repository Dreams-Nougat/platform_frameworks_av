The Mutex is already unlocked when connection so there seems to be 
no point in adding mConnectingDataSource.disconnect() outside of the mutex
in reset() and it is already present inside of the mutex.

When reset_l() aborts the connection and this function returns an error it
will call abortPrepare that signals the preparedcondition so that reset_l can finish.
