The id3 spec says:

"An ID3v2 tag can be detected with the following pattern:
$49 44 33 yy yy xx zz zz zz zz
Where yy is less than $FF, xx is the 'flags' byte and zz is less than $80."

so it might be a good idea to check those yy and zz bytes in addition to the three leading 'ID3' bytes.

Also note that id3v2.4 defines an optional footer at the end of the tag, which is not included in the size. So if the version is 2.4, and the footer-flag is set, another sizeof(id3header) should be added.
